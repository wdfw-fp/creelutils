#' Summarize HMC Diagnostics from a Stan Fit
#'
#' Computes a human-readable summary of key Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) diagnostics
#' from a fitted Stan model object, including divergences, tree depth saturation, and
#' E-BFMI values across chains.
#'
#' This function reconstructs diagnostics similar to `rstan::check_hmc_diagnostics()` but returns
#' a formatted character string instead of printing to the console. This allows the output to be saved,
#' displayed, or logged programmatically.
#'
#' @param stan_fit A fitted Stan model object of class `stanfit`, typically created using `rstan::stan()` or `rstan::sampling()`.
#'
#' @return A single character string summarizing the following diagnostics:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Number and percentage of post-warmup iterations with divergences.
#'   \item Number of iterations that saturated the maximum tree depth.
#'   \item E-BFMI values for each chain, indicating potential energy sampling issues.
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' This function summarizes key Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) convergence diagnostics
#' from a Stan model fit. It is intended to help users assess whether further tuning is
#' needed using available options like `adapt_delta`, `max_treedepth`, or prior adjustments.
#'
#' The diagnostics reported include:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{Divergent transitions}: Should be less than 5% of post-warmup iterations.
#'         Divergences may indicate poor exploration of the posterior and often require increasing
#'         `adapt_delta` (e.g., from 0.75 up toward 0.95 or 0.99) to reduce the step size. Smaller
#'         steps improve numerical stability but increase runtime.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Maximum tree depth}: No iterations should saturate the maximum tree depth.
#'         Saturation may co-occur with high `adapt_delta` due to long trajectories. If frequent,
#'         consider increasing `max_treedepth` above the default (usually 10â€“12).
#'
#'   \item \strong{E-BFMI}: This metric checks whether the energy transitions in HMC are efficient.
#'         E-BFMI below 0.2 is a sign of potential sampling issues, though reparameterization
#'         (typically recommended) is not accessible in this workflow. Instead, consider revisiting
#'         prior distributions to improve geometry.

#' This function is adapted to return results as text, in contrast to `rstan::check_hmc_diagnostics()`
#' which prints directly to the console.
