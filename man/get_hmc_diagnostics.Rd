\title{Summarize HMC Diagnostics from a Stan Fit}
\usage{
get_hmc_diagnostics(stan_fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{stan_fit}{A fitted Stan model object of class \code{stanfit}, typically created using \code{rstan::stan()} or \code{rstan::sampling()}.}
}
\value{
A single character string summarizing the following diagnostics:
\itemize{
\item Number and percentage of post-warmup iterations with divergences.
\item Number of iterations that saturated the maximum tree depth.
\item E-BFMI values for each chain, indicating potential energy sampling issues.
}
}
\description{
Computes a human-readable summary of key Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) diagnostics
from a fitted Stan model object, including divergences, tree depth saturation, and
E-BFMI values across chains.
}
\details{
This function reconstructs diagnostics similar to \code{rstan::check_hmc_diagnostics()} but returns
a formatted character string instead of printing to the console. This allows the output to be saved,
displayed, or logged programmatically.

This function summarizes key Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) convergence diagnostics
from a Stan model fit. It is intended to help users assess whether further tuning is
needed using available options like \code{adapt_delta}, \code{max_treedepth}, or prior adjustments.

The diagnostics reported include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Divergent transitions}: Should be less than 5\% of post-warmup iterations.
Divergences may indicate poor exploration of the posterior and often require increasing
\code{adapt_delta} (e.g., from 0.75 up toward 0.95 or 0.99) to reduce the step size. Smaller
steps improve numerical stability but increase runtime.

\item \strong{Maximum tree depth}: No iterations should saturate the maximum tree depth.
Saturation may co-occur with high \code{adapt_delta} due to long trajectories. If frequent,
consider increasing \code{max_treedepth} above the default (usually 10â€“12).

\item \strong{E-BFMI}: This metric checks whether the energy transitions in HMC are efficient.
E-BFMI below 0.2 is a sign of potential sampling issues, though reparameterization
(typically recommended) is not accessible in this workflow. Instead, consider revisiting
prior distributions to improve geometry.
}

This function is adapted to return results as text, in contrast to \code{rstan::check_hmc_diagnostics()}
which prints directly to the console.
