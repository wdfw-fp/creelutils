}
\arguments{
\item{table_name}{Name of table (e.g., catch, interview, effort)}

\item{query_list}{Basically \code{filter()} statements as a list of named items. Item name matches the column name of the table, and then item should either be an atomic to be matched exactly, or a vector for matching multiple options. See details.}

\value{

\description{
Queries the website storing the creel data, which uses the Socrata API (e.g., https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/where)
}
\details{
The query is focused on filtering, and is designed to be written as an R list, with any number of conditions in it. For example, to return only data in which \code{fishery_name} is "Baker summer sockeye 2022", the query list should include \code{fishery_name = "Baker summer sockeye 2022"}. And to return only data for species "Kokanee" or "Rainbow Trout", the query list should also include \code{species = c("Kokanee", "Rainbow Trout")}.
}
\examples{
table_name = "catch" ## name of table
query_list = list( ## each item in list should be named for a column in the table, and should be
  fishery_name = "Baker summer sockeye 2022",
  fin_mark = "UM",
  species = c("Kokanee", "Rainbow Trout")
)
dat = query_creel_website(table_name, query_list)
head(dat)
}
